# sql-sales

This project analyzes a SALES table using SQL. The tasks include:

Viewing all sales records
Extracting order month and counting total orders per month
Calculating total revenue using SUM()
Measuring order volume using COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)
Filtering records by date to focus on specific time periods

The queries use basic SQL operations such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, MONTH(), SUM(), COUNT(DISTINCT ...), and WHERE clauses to perform the analysis.
